# 🔢 NumPy Projects

Welcome to the **NumPy Projects Repository**!  
This repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks that showcase the power and flexibility of the **NumPy** library for numerical computing in Python.

---

## 📌 Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to practice and demonstrate key functionalities of NumPy including:

- Creating arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Array indexing and slicing
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Reshaping, stacking, and splitting arrays
- Working with random numbers and seed values

---
